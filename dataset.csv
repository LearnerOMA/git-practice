Check Openai President’S Formula For Perfect Prompts ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/how-to-get-accurate-results-from-ai-check-openai-presidents-formula-for-perfect-prompts/articleshow/119470989.cms," Mar 25, 2025, 14:57 (IST)","How to get accurate results from AI Artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT have revolutionized the way users interact with technology, providing assistance in research, content creation, problem-solving, and more. However, many users often struggle with receiving precise and relevant AI-generated responses. The problem lies not in the AI’s capabilities but in how prompts are structured.OpenAI President Greg Brockman recently shared an effective method for crafting AI prompts that significantly enhances response accuracy. This structured approach ensures that AI understands requests clearly, reducing errors and improving overall output quality. By following this framework, users can maximize the efficiency and relevance of AI-generated results, whether for work, education, or personal use.OpenAI’s guide to create perfect prompt and get accurate resultBrockman introduced a structured model initially developed by AI expert Ben Hylak, known as the Anatomy of an AI Prompt. This model identifies four essential elements that contribute to an effective AI prompt:1. Clearly define the goalThe most crucial aspect of crafting an effective prompt is to be specific about the objective. A vague request often leads to a generic or incomplete response. Instead of asking:“Give me hiking recommendations.” A well-structured request would be:“List five medium-length hiking trails within a two-hour drive from San Francisco that offer unique scenery and are lesser-known.” By refining the goal, the AI can generate more targeted and useful recommendations.2. Specify the desired return formatFormatting plays a vital role in AI responses. If a user needs structured information, it’s essential to communicate the preferred output clearly. For instance, specifying:“Provide a numbered list with a brief description of each option.”“Write a detailed comparison in table format.” Ensures that the AI organizes the information accordingly, improving readability and usability.3. Set constraints and warningsIncluding constraints and warnings in the prompt helps guide AI-generated content. For example, if requesting factual data, the user can specify:“Ensure all travel times are accurate and locations exist.”“Verify that historical data is current and sourced from reputable databases.” This step minimizes inaccuracies and ensures that the response adheres to specific criteria.4. Provide context for better resultsContext plays a crucial role in personalizing AI-generated responses. Users should include any relevant background information that might influence the AI’s answer. For example:“I have dietary restrictions (vegetarian) and prefer budget-friendly restaurants. Recommend five places in New York City that fit these criteria.”“I am planning a trip to Europe and prefer cultural experiences over nightlife. Suggest three destinations that align with this preference.” By providing context, the AI can refine its suggestions to better meet the user’s needs.ChatGPT not giving the right answers? Try this prompt formulaAI systems generate responses based on the input they receive. If a user provides incomplete or unclear prompts, the AI may produce vague, irrelevant, or misleading answers. Brockman’s structured framework allows users to fine-tune their interactions with AI, resulting in more accurate and relevant responses.For example, instead of using a broad request like:“Recommend a weekend getaway.” A well-structured prompt following this method would be:“Suggest a unique weekend getaway within a three-hour drive from Los Angeles, emphasizing scenic ocean views, excellent local cuisine, and lesser-known attractions.” This detailed prompt enables AI to provide highly tailored recommendations, eliminating generic responses.Unlock AI’s full potential with smarter promptsWhile AI continues to advance, it is not yet capable of reading a user’s mind. The quality of its output depends on the clarity of the input. Brockman’s approach serves as a roadmap for improving AI interactions, allowing users to leverage AI as a precise and effective tool rather than a system of random guesses.Before submitting any prompt, users should ask themselves: Am I providing all the necessary details to help the AI generate an accurate response? By applying this structured method, individuals and businesses alike can enhance their AI experience, unlocking its full potential in various applications.Also read | Fruit Battlegrounds Codes | Blox Fruits Codes | Peroxide Codes","How to get accurate results from AI Artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT have revolutionized the way users interact with technology, providing assistance in research, content creation, problem-solving, and more.

He also noted that AI-driven job displacement in software engineering would be gradual but is set to accelerate over time.During an interview with Stratechery's Ben Thompson, Altman said: “The obvious tactical thing is just get really good at using AI tools. Like when I was graduating as a senior from high school, the obvious tactical thing was get really good at coding. And this is the new version of that.”“My basic assumption is that each software engineer will just do much, much more for a while. And then at some point, yeah, maybe we do need less software engineers,” he said while talking about OpenAI’s hiring strategy.“It kind of just seeps through the economy and mostly kind of like eats things little by little and then faster and faster,” Altman added.",Representative Image ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Facebook parent Meta Platforms have reportedly held separate discussions with Reliance Industries about potential artificial intelligence (AI) partnerships.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Vembu addressed the growing concerns about AI taking over jobs, offering a balanced perspective on the capabilities and limitations of AI.Vembu acknowledged that AI is capable of handling up to 90% of coding tasks, particularly those involving ""boilerplate"" or repetitive code. However, he stressed the importance of human involvement in addressing ""essential complexity""—the core engineering challenges that require creativity, intuition, and problem-solving skills.""AI can make mincemeat of patterns already discovered by humans. Can it find totally new patterns? That is much rarer and requires qualities like 'taste' or 'knowing where to dig,'"" Vembu wrote, highlighting the unique abilities of humans in discovering new solutions.Read Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s complete post hereWhen people say ""AI will write 90% of the code"" I readily agree because 90% of what programmers write is ""boiler plate"".There is ""essential complexity"" in programming and then there is a lot of ""accidental complexity"" (that is the boiler plate stuff) and this is very old wisdom from the Mythical Man Month.AI is doing a great job eliminating the accidental complexity. Humans still needed to deal with the essential complexity.In essence, AI can make mincemeat of patterns already discovered (by humans). Can it find totally new patterns? As with humans, that is much rarer and a quality known as ""taste"" or ""knowing where to dig"" or ""follow a hunch or conviction all the way"" is needed to discover new patterns. I don't know if AI can do this. I don't know if that can be brute forced.Vembu's remarks come at a time when AI is reshaping the software development landscape, with industry leaders like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicting a reduction in demand for software engineers. Altman has noted that AI is already responsible for generating over 50% of code in many companies, and the trend is expected to grow.Despite these advancements, Vembu believes that human expertise will remain indispensable for tackling complex challenges and driving innovation. Vembu's comments underscore the need for a balanced approach to AI integration, where automation complements human creativity rather than replacing it.","However, he stressed the importance of human involvement in addressing ""essential complexity""—the core engineering challenges that require creativity, intuition, and problem-solving skills.

The billionaire investor said that it is the uniquely human capacity for judgment and discernment that ultimately shapes impactful narratives.“AI can propose a million things in a second, but then somebody's got to go through and decide what they're going to put their money into,” Cuban stated during an episode of the ""YMH"" podcast, Business Insider reported.This essentially addresses the anxiety among creatives, who fear that corporations will leverage AI to eliminate human involvement in production, driven by cost-cutting measures. The gravity of this concern was underscored in 2023, when the Writers Guild of America and the actors' union SAG-AFTRA initiated a joint strike, bringing Hollywood to a standstill. A key objective of this strike was to secure robust protections for their members against the ""existential threat"" posed by AI.Cuban maintains that AI, on its own, is incapable of producing commercially viable creative output. “AI is not going to, you know, hit your bank account and produce a movie for you, produce a podcast or whatever,” Cuban said on the podcast. Cuban added that AI shouldn't have the final word in the creative process, saying, “I think AI is just one more creative tool. It's like a writing or creative partner, but not a decision-maker.”Cuban says success of creative product is based on instinct that AI cannot replicateCuban believes that the success of a creative product often hinges on an intuitive understanding of audience preferences, a quality that cannot be replicated by a machine. “There is a distinct reason why certain individuals consistently produce hit after hit, regardless of whether it's in music, books, poetry, movies, or television.

However, speaking on Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath's podcast, he said that there is one area where people may pick the best.When asked how the Big Tech is doing things differently, Srinivas observed a striking similarity among the major players.“[The] honest answer right now is all of them are doing similar things. I'll just say it as blunt as it can be. There's not really a genuine differentiation between ChatGPT or Anthropic or Gemini or Grok or Meta AI right now and, of course, Perplexity. You can argue similarly,” he said, attributing this behaviour to the industry's focus on common evaluation metrics.“Currently, excluding the search part, most models give the same answers,” he explained. “This is because they are trying to climb on the same benchmarks, same leaderboards. There isn't a lot of qualitative difference,” he explained.‘Perplexity differentiated itself by providing sources but…’: SrinivasWhile Perplexity initially differentiated itself by emphasizing accurate sourcing – a feature Srinivas notes competitors are now emulating – he suggested current users' choice often boils down to specific task suitability. “In the beginning, the differentiation was we were the only ones to make sure you always had sources for everything – highly accurate sources, fast answers and so on but everybody else is also realising that the real values in search even more than free form chat. And they're trying to put sources for almost any response so I think right now we're in this weird phase where like all AI chatbots seem similar,” he added.However, the one area Srinivas pointed out that makes all chatbots different is fact checking and research. “If you use AI for fact checks and research, financial research etc, you would pick whichever model does that best,” he commented.Nevertheless, Srinivas predicts this landscape of similarity is poised for a shift. The crucial differentiator in the near future, he argued, will be the development of “agentic behaviour” – AI systems capable of performing tasks, not just generating text.“Answering questions will be seen as a commodity—just answering in text will not cut it,” Srinivas made a prediction for 2025. He believes future advancements will involve AI generating richer outputs like graphics and charts and, more significantly, actively “doing things” for the user.This evolution towards action-oriented AI, Srinivas noted, is dependent on sophisticated reasoning capabilities, which he believes are only just beginning to function successfully within AI systems.","There isn't a lot of qualitative difference,” he explained.‘Perplexity differentiated itself by providing sources but…’: SrinivasWhile Perplexity initially differentiated itself by emphasizing accurate sourcing – a feature Srinivas notes competitors are now emulating – he suggested current users' choice often boils down to specific task suitability.

Since its advent, the debate over whether it is a kingpin of progress or a disruptor of livelihoods rages on, but one truth remains immutable: AI is here to stay. Those who embrace its tide will soar to new professional heights, while those who resist will inevitably be left behind.A recent report by Bain & Company paints a compelling picture of AI’s meteoric rise in the job market, forecasting over 2.3 million AI-related openings in India alone by 2027. Yet, lurking behind this silver lining is a sobering reality—India lacks the skilled workforce to meet this surging demand, leaving a gaping chasm of over a million unfilled roles. While some professionals fear AI will render their skills obsolete, others see it as an unparalleled opportunity. The key differentiator? Upskilling. As Darwin’s theory of ‘survival of the fittest’ aptly suggests, adaptation is the only path forward. Artificial intelligence is no longer an encroaching force; it is an inextricable part of our world. Resisting its ascent is futile—mastering its potential is the only way to thrive.AI jobs set to surge in the near futureArtificial intelligence has emerged as a powerful force, reshaping not just the way industries operate but the very core of the job market. As corporations race to integrate AI-driven solutions, the demand for skilled talent is skyrocketing at an unprecedented pace.According to a report issued by Bain & Company, a renowned global management consulting firm, over 2.3 million job openings will emerge in India by 2027. However, despite a booming job market and an expanding workforce, the country is still expected to witness a massive talent crunch. The report highlights that India will experience a crippling talent deficit, with over 1 million skilled professionals missing from the workforce, threatening to impede progress.This phenomenon is not exclusive to India. The United States is on course to see AI job demands exceed 1.3 million roles by 2027, with a projected shortfall of 700,000 professionals. Germany, the United Kingdom, and Australia are also facing staggering talent gaps, as AI vacancies far outstrip the available expertise. As businesses accelerate efforts to harness the full potential of AI, it is high time for professionals to align with industry trends—or risk being left behind.AI talent crisis: What the Bain & Company report unveilsThe Bain & Company study delivers an unflinching reality check—while AI-related job openings have surged by 21% annually since 2019, the supply of skilled professionals has remained woefully inadequate. AI salaries have climbed at an 11% annual rate, reflecting the premium placed on artificial intelligence expertise. However, the prevailing talent crunch is slowing the momentum of AI adoption across industries.A major culprit? The dire lack of in-house AI expertise. The report reveals that a staggering 44% of global executives cite this deficiency as the biggest roadblock to implementing generative AI. India, despite being home to a vast talent pool, risks squandering a golden opportunity unless large-scale reskilling and upskilling initiatives come to the forefront. Traditional hiring strategies are obsolete—companies must revolutionize talent development, cultivate AI expertise internally, and foster an aggressive learning culture to stay ahead of the curve.Upskilling as the key to AI career dominationWith AI job opportunities exploding and businesses scrambling for elite talent, upskilling has emerged as the ultimate game-changer. The Career Progression Report 2024-25 by Great Learning provides irrefutable proof—continuous learning is the gateway to unparalleled career acceleration.According to the report, an overwhelming 80% of professionals who upskilled in AI, Data Science, and Machine Learning experienced transformative career shifts—securing promotions, commanding salary surges, and navigating seamless career transitions. Remarkably, within just two years of upskilling, 74% of professionals saw upward mobility, with 69% successfully securing new roles, either within their current organizations or elsewhere.Upskilling helps professionals climb to leadership positionsThe data speaks for itself—upskilling is not just about technical prowess; it is the ticket to leadership. The Great Learning report reveals that, post-upskilling, leadership roles doubled, while team management positions rose by 80%. AI expertise is no longer merely a technical skill—it has become a leadership imperative. As businesses intensify their digital transformation, professionals equipped with AI capabilities are ascending into strategic positions, steering organizations through the complexities of an AI-powered future.Salary windfalls post-upskillingFinancial growth is a driving factor for many professionals, and upskilling has proven to be a catalyst in this journey. The Great Learning data reveals that early-career professionals (0-3 years of experience) secured an astronomical 139% salary hike post upskilling. Mid-career professionals (3-8 years of experience) saw a formidable 93% surge, while those with 8-12 years of experience commanded a 50% boost. Even senior professionals, with over 12 years in the field, reaped an impressive 41% increase. The message is clear—mastering AI is the surefire path to financial growth and career longevity.Career security over short-term gainsWhile salary hikes are a compelling incentive, a fundamental shift is underway. The report highlights that 60% of professionals pursued upskilling not merely for financial gains but to fortify their career security in an era of relentless technological upheaval. Only 13% upskilled solely for salary increments, underscoring the growing realization that AI expertise is a survival skill in the modern job market.The future of AI careers: A war for talentNot only is the AI job market expanding, but it is also turning into a battlefield for elite talent. Businesses are deploying aggressive hiring strategies, and the real winners will be those who future-proof themselves through relentless upskilling.The impending AI job boom and expected talent crunch are real. In this era, upskilling is no longer an option or a sidelined to-do list—it is the defining factor that separates success from obsolescence. The AI revolution is knocking at the door; those who evolve with it will thrive, while those who fail to adapt will be left behind.","Those who embrace its tide will soar to new professional heights, while those who resist will inevitably be left behind.A recent report by Bain & Company paints a compelling picture of AI’s meteoric rise in the job market, forecasting over 2.3 million AI-related openings in India alone by 2027.

Standard Series models will feature cameras embedded within the display, similar to the front-facing camera on iPhones, while Apple Watch Ultra models will have cameras positioned on the side near the Digital Crown and button, Gurman reported.These new watches will expand Apple's Visual Intelligence feature beyond smartphones. Visual Intelligence, which debuted with the iPhone 16, allows users to analyze objects and text using AI tools from ChatGPT and Google Search. The feature will soon reach iPhone 15 Pro models with iOS 18.4 next month.Apple Watch may still not get this iPhone featureGurman's report suggests the cameras are not intended for FaceTime calls but rather to enable practical AI features. For example, users could point their watch at a restaurant to instantly receive information about business hours or ratings as they walk by.Mike Rockwell, who previously led development of Apple's Vision Pro headset, will play a key role in bringing AI features to Apple's wearable devices while continuing to work on visionOS.According to the Bloomberg report, Apple's strategy includes transitioning Visual Intelligence from relying on third-party AI models to using its own in-house technology by the time these new wearables launch.Apple is also developing camera-equipped AirPods with similar AI capabilities, further expanding its AI wearables ecosystem, Gurman noted in his newsletter.","The feature will soon reach iPhone 15 Pro models with iOS 18.4 next month.Apple Watch may still not get this iPhone featureGurman's report suggests the cameras are not intended for FaceTime calls but rather to enable practical AI features.

More than 400 stars have signed an open letter to President Donald Trump’s administration, urging them to protect existing copyright laws. This move comes in response to efforts by OpenAI and Google to loosen these protections, allowing AI to train on copyrighted content without permission or payment to creators.Hollywood’s concerns over AI and copyrightAs per TOI, the letter, sent to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, highlights fears within the creative community that weakening copyright rules could harm the entertainment industry. The signatories stress that the US should not achieve AI leadership at the cost of its creative industries.""We firmly believe that America's global AI leadership must not come at the expense of our essential creative industries,"" states the letter. It was signed by actors, filmmakers, writers, and musicians such as Cate Blanchett, Guillermo del Toro, and Aubrey Plaza.OpenAI and Google say the US should loosen copyright laws to stay ahead in AI, especially against China. They believe AI should be free to learn from copyrighted content under fair use. Google says text-and-data mining is key for AI progress. OpenAI warns that strict rules could slow innovation and weaken the US in the global AI race. They argue that making AI companies negotiate deals with every rights holder would be too difficult and would hold back technology growth.Hollywood’s response to tech giantsThe Hollywood signatories strongly disagree with these claims. They argue that AI companies should be required to obtain proper licenses for using copyrighted material, just like any other industry.They also point out that the entertainment industry plays a major role in the US economy, employing over 2.3 million people and paying $229 billion in wages each year. According to the letter, allowing AI to freely use copyrighted material without paying creators would harm the industry’s economic and cultural strength. The signatories specifically call out OpenAI and Google for trying to gain special government exemptions, despite their huge financial power. Google is valued at around $2 trillion, while OpenAI has a valuation of over $157 billion.Wider impact beyond HollywoodThis issue is not just about Hollywood. The letter warns that weakening copyright protections could hurt other industries as well, including publishing, photography, architecture, design, science, engineering, and software development. It stresses that protecting intellectual property is essential to maintaining America’s leadership in creative fields. ""America didn't become a global cultural powerhouse by accident,"" the letter states. ""Our success stems directly from our fundamental respect for IP and copyright that rewards creative risk-taking by talented and hardworking Americans.""This move by Hollywood is part of a larger backlash against AI companies using copyrighted content without permissionThe letter was submitted before Saturday's midnight deadline.

He also shared examples of how he uses the tool effectively in his daily life. “Frankly, if you haven’t found something where it's useful to you, about something you care about, then you're not trying hard enough, you're not being original enough,” Hoffman stated during an interview on The Economist podcast, broadcast this week (via Business Insider).How LinkedIn founder says he uses AIHoffman detailed his personal use of the technology for learning and investment decision-making. He cited an example of utilising ChatGPT-4 by OpenAI to dissect complex research papers, such as those on quantum mechanics, and requesting explanations tailored to varying levels of comprehension.“I give it a research paper on quantum mechanics and ask it to explain it at varying levels of complexity — as though I were age 12, 18, or a physics undergraduate student,” he explained.“That's probably my most common case,” he said.Reid Hoffman uses OpenAI’s ChatGPTHoffman also highlighted his frequent use of OpenAI's Deep Research tool, likening it to a “super-powered undergraduate research assistant.” While acknowledging its intelligence, he noted its occasional lack of common sense and propensity for inaccuracies, necessitating cross-verification.

The celebrities snapped a photograph with the Prime Minister to capture the unforgettable moment of their life. For the event, Vijay Deverakonda donned a green Bandhgala Sherwani, while Amit Sadh attended the meet in a khaki blazer and pants. Yami Gautam looked beautiful in a purple dress. At the event, PM Narendra Modi underlined India's transformation from dependence to self-reliance over the last decade, asserting that the dream of a developed India by 2047 can only be achieved through collective effort.Speaking at the TV9 summit, PM Modi said that India is no longer just a nation of dreams but one that delivers on them.""We must reflect on the past to understand how India has progressed--from dependence to self-reliance, from aspiration to achievement. A decade ago, mothers and sisters were forced to limit themselves between sunset and sunrise for basic sanitation needs, but the Swachh Bharat Mission has resolved that,"" the Prime Minister said.Highlighting welfare initiatives under his government, PM Modi cited Ayushman Bharat as a solution to expensive medical care that plagued the poor in 2013. ""In 2013, expensive medical care was a challenge, but Ayushman Bharat has provided a solution. Today, they have access to water from every household through 'Har Ghar Se Nal Jal.'""He also noted reforms in the taxation system, saying, ""Our government uses every penny of taxpayers' money with honesty and also respects the taxpayers. The government has made the tax system more taxpayer-friendly.""""In the last 10-11 years, India has transformed across every sector and progressed in every field--and this significant change has come from a shift in mindset. For several decades after Independence, a narrative was promoted in India that considered only foreign things to be superior,"" he added.Citing the evolution of India's banking landscape, he said, ""Sixty years ago, bank nationalisation was implemented to ease access to services, but the reality was that many villages still lacked basic banking facilities. Today, we have transformed the banking landscape with online banking accessible from home and a banking touchpoint within 5 km of every area.""PM Modi added that the country has not just improved infrastructure but also strengthened the banking system nationwide.

Once that happens, the Yogi model of governance would be repeated in the entire country,"" Prakash told TOI. He termed Yogi as a neta who represents the aspirations of the Hindu community.Prakash said that hoisting the Hindutva flag was the need of the hour, which Yogi has consistently done as a party leader. ""Taking a hardline stance is a requisite from the point of politics. It is also in consonance with the feelings of several Hindus,"" he said.Prakash's statement came two days after he said that deputy CM Keshav Maurya should take over from ""baba"" (a reference to Yogi), who should ""go to Delhi"". He said Maurya's ascendency as UP CM would fulfil the ""aspiration of thousands of people from the backward classes"".The five-term Dalit MLA is a known turncoat. He represented the Ahirori reserved seat in 1996 and 2004 as a BSP MLA. In 2012, he switched to SP, winning from the Gopamau seat in Hardoi. In 2017, Prakash joined the saffron bandwagon, winning from the same seat for the next two consecutive terms.Experts said Prakash's statement reflects a growing sentiment among some BJP supporters about the future leadership of the party.

Once that happens, the Yogi model of governance would be repeated in the entire country,"" Prakash told TOI. He termed Yogi as a neta who represents the aspirations of the Hindu community.Prakash said that hoisting the Hindutva flag was the need of the hour, which Yogi has consistently done as a party leader. ""Taking a hardline stance is a requisite from the point of politics. It is also in consonance with the feelings of several Hindus,"" he said.Prakash's statement came two days after he said that deputy CM Keshav Maurya should take over from ""baba"" (a reference to Yogi), who should ""go to Delhi"". He said Maurya's ascendency as UP CM would fulfil the ""aspiration of thousands of people from the backward classes"".The five-term Dalit MLA is a known turncoat. He represented the Ahirori reserved seat in 1996 and 2004 as a BSP MLA. In 2012, he switched to SP, winning from the Gopamau seat in Hardoi. In 2017, Prakash joined the saffron bandwagon, winning from the same seat for the next two consecutive terms.Experts said Prakash's statement reflects a growing sentiment among some BJP supporters about the future leadership of the party.

From moringa paratha to immunity-boosting kadha, he swears by all healthy foods to lead a healthy lifestyle. In the most recently aired Lex Fridman postcast, he opened about his fitness routine and his daily food habits.Stressing on the importance of fasting he said that fasting ""never slows me down"". 74-year-old Modi, added, “I work just as much as usual. Sometimes, I even work more. And another fascinating thing I’ve noticed is that when I need to express my thoughts, I’m amazed at where they come from and how they flow. It’s truly an incredible experience. Fasting for me is devotion, fasting for me is self-discipline.”During the podcast chat, he mentioned about the tradition of Chaturmas and how the season defines his food habits and fitness routine. PM Modi said that he eats only a single meal within 24 hours between mid-June and November. He added, For about four to four and a half months, I follow this tradition of eating only once in 24 hours.And during the Shardiya Navratri, he “completely” abstains from food and only drinks hot water.

Perhaps I can say that I’ve been following these practices for 50 to 55 years.""Benefits of drinking hot waterDrinking hot water is said to improve digestion by stimulating the digestive tract and breaking down food more efficiently.

Once that happens, the Yogi model of governance would be repeated in the entire country,"" Prakash told TOI. He termed Yogi as a neta who represents the aspirations of the Hindu community.Prakash said that hoisting the Hindutva flag was the need of the hour, which Yogi has consistently done as a party leader. ""Taking a hardline stance is a requisite from the point of politics. It is also in consonance with the feelings of several Hindus,"" he said.Prakash's statement came two days after he said that deputy CM Keshav Maurya should take over from ""baba"" (a reference to Yogi), who should ""go to Delhi"". He said Maurya's ascendency as UP CM would fulfil the ""aspiration of thousands of people from the backward classes"".The five-term Dalit MLA is a known turncoat. He represented the Ahirori reserved seat in 1996 and 2004 as a BSP MLA. In 2012, he switched to SP, winning from the Gopamau seat in Hardoi. In 2017, Prakash joined the saffron bandwagon, winning from the same seat for the next two consecutive terms.Experts said Prakash's statement reflects a growing sentiment among some BJP supporters about the future leadership of the party. By proposing Yogi's name as Modi's successor, the MLA is aligning with BJP's Hindu-centric identity, represented by leaders like Yogi, an analyst said.","It is also in consonance with the feelings of several Hindus,"" he said.Prakash's statement came two days after he said that deputy CM Keshav Maurya should take over from ""baba"" (a reference to Yogi), who should ""go to Delhi"".

From moringa paratha to immunity-boosting kadha, he swears by all healthy foods to lead a healthy lifestyle. In the most recently aired Lex Fridman postcast, he opened about his fitness routine and his daily food habits.Stressing on the importance of fasting he said that fasting ""never slows me down"". 74-year-old Modi, added, “I work just as much as usual. Sometimes, I even work more. And another fascinating thing I’ve noticed is that when I need to express my thoughts, I’m amazed at where they come from and how they flow. It’s truly an incredible experience. Fasting for me is devotion, fasting for me is self-discipline.”During the podcast chat, he mentioned about the tradition of Chaturmas and how the season defines his food habits and fitness routine. PM Modi said that he eats only a single meal within 24 hours between mid-June and November. He added, For about four to four and a half months, I follow this tradition of eating only once in 24 hours.And during the Shardiya Navratri, he “completely” abstains from food and only drinks hot water. He said, “Although drinking hot water has always been a part of my daily routine, my past lifestyle was such that I naturally developed this habit over time.""As per the podcast, during Chaitra Navratri, he eats only one specific fruit, once a day. He added in the conversation. ""So for those nine days, if let’s say I choose papaya, then for all nine days, I won’t touch anything else. Just papaya. That too, I eat only once a day. That’s how I follow my nine-day fasting routine. So there are numerous fasts I keep throughout the year, and this has become a deeply ingrained tradition in my life. Perhaps I can say that I’ve been following these practices for 50 to 55 years.""Benefits of drinking hot waterDrinking hot water is said to improve digestion by stimulating the digestive tract and breaking down food more efficiently. Hot water also aids in detoxification, flushing out toxins and improving kidney function. It can boost metabolism and support weight loss by increasing calorie burning. Additionally, warm water soothes sore throats, relieves nasal congestion, and promotes relaxation, making it beneficial for respiratory health.Side effects of drinking hot waterIt is said that drinking extremely hot water can burn your tongue, throat, and esophagus, causing irritation or long-term damage. Also, regular consumption of very hot water may weaken tooth enamel, leading to increased sensitivity.Benefits of fruit dietA fruit-based diet is packed with essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, offering numerous health benefits including boosting immunity, aids weight loss, improves digestion, supports heart health, and also detoxifies the body.Disclaimer: When it comes to dietary changes, every body is very subjective and one should always consult a certified nutritionist or medical practitioner before making any changes.","So there are numerous fasts I keep throughout the year, and this has become a deeply ingrained tradition in my life.

If the tax system is simple and effective, then traders, entrepreneurs, and investors benefit, and economic activities grow rapidly, said Saini. The CM was speaking as the chief guest at a function organised for the launch of the ‘One Time Settlement Scheme – 2025' in Kurukshetra. Saini said the OTS scheme would provide great relief to thousands of taxpayers, especially small shopkeepers, entrepreneurs, and traders. This scheme will give an opportunity to taxpayers to make a new beginning by freeing them from the old financial burden, he said.The scheme is for those taxpayers of Haryana who could not pay the outstanding amount of their taxes due to various reasons. Under this scheme, taxpayers with dues up to Rs 10 lakh will get a rebate of up to Rs 1 lakh, he added. Notably, Saini had made an announcement regarding the OTS scheme in his budget speech last week. Saini said the scheme would remain in force for the coming 180 days.The CM, meanwhile, said the state govt had started a dispute resolution programme to address the problems of the people from all sections of society. Under the programme, various departments have started schemes with different names. The ‘One Time Settlement Scheme – 2025' is also a part of the initiative, he said. The excise and taxation department of Haryana has been facing great difficulty in recovering the outstanding taxes due to various reasons. Therefore, we implemented the ‘One Time Settlement Scheme' to reduce the outstanding taxes and litigation and expedite the recovery of outstanding amounts. While implementing this scheme will provide relief to taxpayers, it will also increase the revenue collection, Saini added. As per information, the govt has created three slabs for the payment of outstanding taxes for the convenience of taxpayers. For payment of cumulative assessed outstanding tax up to Rs 10 lakh, the taxpayer will have to pay 40% of the amount after deducting the exemption of up to Rs 1 lakh. For cumulative assessed outstanding tax liabilities of more than Rs 10 lakh and up to Rs 10 crore, the taxpayer will have to pay 50% of the amount. Similarly, the taxpayer will have to pay 100% of the cumulative assessed outstanding tax liabilities of more than Rs 10 crore.The CM said other suggestions received include GST exemption on agricultural equipment, automation of GST refund, annual self-assessment instead of monthly, and increasing the limit of issuing bills from Rs 5 crore to Rs 10 crore.

This agreement between the IRS and DHS — if finalized — will have long-lasting and devastating implications on our economy, taxpayer privacy, immigrant communities, and the rule of law.” They have called upon the Trump Administration to make their plans public. The IRS and DHS must disclose the extent of this agreement and brief Congress immediately, they stated.Earlier, they, along with more than a dozen senators, had written to high-ranking officials in the DHS and IRS demanding transparency regarding any ongoing or planned data-sharing agreements.The senators pointed out that providing DHS with taxpayer addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses—particularly of undocumented immigrants using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs)—could lead to the weaponization of the tax system against vulnerable communities. The lawmakers also condemned reports that DHS and DOGE officials sought to cross-reference IRS data with federal benefits databases, calling such efforts a blatant violation of Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, which strictly protects taxpayer confidentiality.“Taxpayer data is subject to some of the strongest privacy protections under federal law. These safeguards were put in place after President Nixon used the IRS to target political enemies,” the letter stated. “If taxpayers believe their private financial information could be used against them, they will be less likely to comply with tax laws.”The letter also referenced concerns about the recent abrupt removal of William Paul as Acting IRS Chief Counsel. News reports suggest Paul was reassigned due to his resistance to breaking privacy laws. Lastly, the senators stated that granting DHS and DOGE access to taxpayer information could not only erode trust in the IRS but also negatively impact tax enforcement. They noted that IRS auditors are already stretched thin, and diverting them to investigate small businesses suspected of employing undocumented workers would take resources away from pursuing large-scale tax fraud and corporate evasion.","File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP) A group of US senators have raised alarms over reports that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are seeking unprecedented access to sensitive taxpayer data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).Senators Alex Padilla, Catherine Cortez Masto and Ron Wyden have released a joint statement: “This weekend, it became clear that the Trump Administration is finalizing plans to target and penalize people who are following federal law and contributing to our economy. “If taxpayers believe their private financial information could be used against them, they will be less likely to comply with tax laws.”The letter also referenced concerns about the recent abrupt removal of William Paul as Acting IRS Chief Counsel."

Under the new changes, which will be applicable from April 1, the power of scrutiny and issuing notices has been transferred to deputy excise and taxation commissioners (DETCs) from excise and taxation officers (ETOs).Withdrawal of certain powers from ETOs (inspector rank officers) and their transfer to a deputy commissioner rank officer is expected to bring accountability and reduce harassment of honest taxpayers. Setting up a panel of CAs for special audits, one-time settlement (OTS) scheme, installation of CCTV cameras in offices for transparency, changes in the system of (annual) audit, rebates up to 60% and waiver up to 100% (in certain cases) — these are among the key changes that may give relief to traders and businessmen. The state has introduced the OTS scheme, which will be implemented from next week. The scheme will be applicable to small taxpayers. Traders with pending dues of less than Rs 1 lakh will receive a 100% waiver. The state will waive off their tax, interest and penalty.For traders with pending tax dues of Rs 1 to Rs 10 lakh, the govt will give a rebate of 60% on the principal tax amount, interest and penalty. Around 1.5 lakh traders in this category will benefit.For traders with pending dues of Rs 10 lakh to Rs 10 crore, the state will give a rebate of 50% on the principal tax amount, interest, and penalty. In total, nearly 2 lakh small and medium traders and businessmen will benefit.GST expert and former chairman of NIRC of ICAI Naveen Garg said the transfer of power from lower-level officers to senior officers is expected to reduce the chances of harassment to traders and businessmen. ""The commissioner rank officers have more knowledge and experience and they have a better understanding. It will increase accountability,"" said Garg, adding that the changes will increase the ease of doing business in the state and will also attract investment and businesses from other states.Garg said Haryana is the first state to make such changes, and it will encourage other states to bring in similar changes in their respective regions. He said the provision for installing CCTV cameras in the offices of ETO and DETC will also help in bringing transparency to the system.The govt has also made changes in the system of audit. Until now, traders and businesses had to undergo annual audits. Now, they will have to undergo audits once every four-five years. The state has decided to form a panel of CAs for special audits to be conducted on behalf of the department. ""This will save time as it will reduce the number of trips to GST offices by traders and businesses,"" said Garg. He emphasised that the department is for collecting tax from tax evaders and checking irregularities, and it should not harass honest taxpayers.Under the GST law, taxes are calculated and collected based on self-declarations given by traders and businesses. However, the department has the power to scrutinise and issue notices to check for any tax evasion and irregularities. In cases where a notice is issued by the SGST, the business must pay upfront 10% of the tax amount for which the notice was issued before they can appeal against the notice. ""This blocks the capital of the business and puts the burden of litigation and paperwork, which obstructs the business,"" CA Nimesh Vashisht said, adding that even if businesses get relief in appeal, the entire process wastes several months and creates hurdles for the businesses.From April 1, in cases related to tax collection of more than Rs 2 crore, the deputy excise taxation commissioner (DETC) will have the power to issue notices, whereas previously, the excise taxation officer (ETO) had this power. Similarly, the power of suo moto investigation (scrutiny) in cases of tax evasion was taken from the ETO and given to the joint excise and taxation commissioner. ""The chief minister held a series of meetings with the CA association and other bodies to seek their suggestions in Jan. Changes have been made based on the suggestions and feedback given to the chief minister,"" a senior govt official said. He said that the objective is to make the state business-friendly.According to experts, these changes will increase the ease of doing business and attract new investments and businesses to the state. For the financial year 2024-25, the state has set a target of Rs 63,348 crore, and by March 12, 2025, the state has already collected Rs 58,693 crore.","Setting up a panel of CAs for special audits, one-time settlement (OTS) scheme, installation of CCTV cameras in offices for transparency, changes in the system of (annual) audit, rebates up to 60% and waiver up to 100% (in certain cases) — these are among the key changes that may give relief to traders and businessmen.

The findings, presented in the Gujarat assembly, highlight significant revenue risks.The audit examined 1,262 refund claims between July 2017 and July 2020, revealing delays in 45% of acknowledgements, some stretching up to 385 days, while 15% of refund orders took as long as 347 days. Provisional refunds for zero-rated supplies faced delays of up to 44 days, according to the report.CAG also pointed out irregular approvals under the inverted duty structure, leading to incorrect refunds of Rs 91.17 lakh, and excess refunds of Rs 2.33 crore due to input tax credit (ITC) mismatches. Refunds were frequently issued without proper documentation, with some cases involving duplicate or time-barred claims.A major concern was the absence of post-audit checks, which resulted in double payments and unauthorised refund sanctions. The audit recommends stricter monitoring, enhanced compliance mechanisms, and a stronger grievance redressal system.Box: GST audit uncovers 466cr compliance gapsA subject specific compliance audit (SSCA) of Gujarat's GST department found compliance deficiencies amounting to Rs 466.40 crore. The audit, covering the 2017-18 period, assessed data inconsistencies, tax payments, and return filing processes. It examined 10 jurisdictional units, 385 high-value mismatches, and 50 taxpayers, finding discrepancies in management information system (MIS) reports on suo motu cancellations and REG-17 notices. Of the 385 inconsistencies identified, 145 cases (38%) revealed major lapses, including incorrect turnover declarations, ITC mismatches, and short tax payments. Additionally, granular taxpayer records were unavailable in 49 out of 50 cases, posing a potential revenue risk of Rs 319.92 crore.Box: 35.49cr transitional credit lapses CAG also flagged deficiencies in Gujarat's GST transitional credit verification, amounting to Rs 35.49 crore in non-compliance. Despite repeated requests, the department failed to provide records for 1,204 cases, preventing an assessment of the verification process. A sample audit of 86 cases across six divisions found non-compliance in 18 cases (20.93%), including excess ITC carry-forward, ineligible credit claims, and non-levy of interest on irregular credit usage.

This move is part of the 59 amendments to the Finance Bill presented by Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary in the Lok Sabha, which is expected to benefit advertisers on digital platforms like Google, X (formerly Twitter), and Meta.Introduced in June 2016, the 6% Equalisation Levy on online advertisement services was designed to tax digital advertising services provided by foreign companies. The Finance Bill amendment will remove this levy starting April 1, 2025, thus reducing the tax burden on digital ad consumers and platforms.The original Equalisation Levy focused on digital advertising services, including the provision of digital advertising space. In 2020, its scope was extended to e-commerce transactions, imposing a 2% levy on e-commerce supplies, which was abolished in August 2024.Experts suggest that the proposal to remove the 6% levy is part of India’s efforts to maintain a cooperative stance with the US, which had threatened to introduce reciprocal tariffs from April 2. Deloitte India Partner Sumit Singhania noted that the move aligns with the ongoing simplification of income tax laws in India.AKM Global Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari told PTI that while the 2% levy faced more criticism from the US, this decision reflects India’s attempt to address concerns from its trading partners, particularly the US, and ease tensions.Vishwas Panjiar, Partner at Nangia Andersen LLP, welcomed the move, highlighting that it provides certainty for taxpayers and addresses concerns over the unilateral nature of the levy raised by partner countries like the US.Along with the Equalisation Levy removal, the government has also proposed changes to ease offshore fund investments and amended provisions related to search and seizure assessments in tax mattersStay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.Boost your business with AI.

""The civic authorities did not approach us to get us in the tax net when our housing society received the completion certificate around two and a half years ago. We took voluntary measures so that proper property tax is charged. In such cases, it is unjust to levy late payment charges on us,"" he said.The CSMC imposes a 2% late payment charge per month if the property tax is not paid for the first half before June 30 and before Dec 31 for the second half of the financial year. The monthly late payment charges have a compounding effect on the original tax amount. Many people whose properties were newly recorded are reeling under the financial burden.Earlier, the municipal limits had a large number of unregistered properties, even if property holders were occupying them for a considerable period. The CSMC announced 65% more tax if a property was recorded after the end of the last fiscal year. The decision, which was dubbed controversial and arbitrary by citizens, resulted in many citizens ensuring their property gets recorded with the civic body.Shiv Sena (UBT) politician and former standing committee chairman of CSMC, Raju Vaidya, said the sole rule of the administrator has paved the way for anarchy. ""The date of the property coming on record should be considered while imposing late payment charges. The CSMC itself gives the completion certificate and henceforth should become proactive in charging the property tax instead of making citizens run from pillar to post to come under the tax net,"" he said.When contacted, CSMC authorities said late payment charges are applied as per established rules. ""In many cases, we bring new properties under the tax net immediately after citizens start residing in them. In some cases, alert citizens ensure the completion of property tax-related formalities.

If the tax system is simple and effective, then traders, entrepreneurs, and investors benefit, and economic activities grow rapidly, said Saini. The CM was speaking as the chief guest at a function organised for the launch of the ‘One Time Settlement Scheme – 2025' in Kurukshetra. Saini said the OTS scheme would provide great relief to thousands of taxpayers, especially small shopkeepers, entrepreneurs, and traders. This scheme will give an opportunity to taxpayers to make a new beginning by freeing them from the old financial burden, he said.The scheme is for those taxpayers of Haryana who could not pay the outstanding amount of their taxes due to various reasons. Under this scheme, taxpayers with dues up to Rs 10 lakh will get a rebate of up to Rs 1 lakh, he added. Notably, Saini had made an announcement regarding the OTS scheme in his budget speech last week. Saini said the scheme would remain in force for the coming 180 days.The CM, meanwhile, said the state govt had started a dispute resolution programme to address the problems of the people from all sections of society. Under the programme, various departments have started schemes with different names. The ‘One Time Settlement Scheme – 2025' is also a part of the initiative, he said. The excise and taxation department of Haryana has been facing great difficulty in recovering the outstanding taxes due to various reasons. Therefore, we implemented the ‘One Time Settlement Scheme' to reduce the outstanding taxes and litigation and expedite the recovery of outstanding amounts. While implementing this scheme will provide relief to taxpayers, it will also increase the revenue collection, Saini added. As per information, the govt has created three slabs for the payment of outstanding taxes for the convenience of taxpayers. For payment of cumulative assessed outstanding tax up to Rs 10 lakh, the taxpayer will have to pay 40% of the amount after deducting the exemption of up to Rs 1 lakh. For cumulative assessed outstanding tax liabilities of more than Rs 10 lakh and up to Rs 10 crore, the taxpayer will have to pay 50% of the amount. Similarly, the taxpayer will have to pay 100% of the cumulative assessed outstanding tax liabilities of more than Rs 10 crore.The CM said other suggestions received include GST exemption on agricultural equipment, automation of GST refund, annual self-assessment instead of monthly, and increasing the limit of issuing bills from Rs 5 crore to Rs 10 crore. The Haryana govt will recommend these suggestions to the GST council, he said.

This agreement between the IRS and DHS — if finalized — will have long-lasting and devastating implications on our economy, taxpayer privacy, immigrant communities, and the rule of law.” They have called upon the Trump Administration to make their plans public. The IRS and DHS must disclose the extent of this agreement and brief Congress immediately, they stated.Earlier, they, along with more than a dozen senators, had written to high-ranking officials in the DHS and IRS demanding transparency regarding any ongoing or planned data-sharing agreements.The senators pointed out that providing DHS with taxpayer addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses—particularly of undocumented immigrants using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs)—could lead to the weaponization of the tax system against vulnerable communities. The lawmakers also condemned reports that DHS and DOGE officials sought to cross-reference IRS data with federal benefits databases, calling such efforts a blatant violation of Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, which strictly protects taxpayer confidentiality.“Taxpayer data is subject to some of the strongest privacy protections under federal law. These safeguards were put in place after President Nixon used the IRS to target political enemies,” the letter stated. “If taxpayers believe their private financial information could be used against them, they will be less likely to comply with tax laws.”The letter also referenced concerns about the recent abrupt removal of William Paul as Acting IRS Chief Counsel. News reports suggest Paul was reassigned due to his resistance to breaking privacy laws. Lastly, the senators stated that granting DHS and DOGE access to taxpayer information could not only erode trust in the IRS but also negatively impact tax enforcement. They noted that IRS auditors are already stretched thin, and diverting them to investigate small businesses suspected of employing undocumented workers would take resources away from pursuing large-scale tax fraud and corporate evasion.","File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP) A group of US senators have raised alarms over reports that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are seeking unprecedented access to sensitive taxpayer data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).Senators Alex Padilla, Catherine Cortez Masto and Ron Wyden have released a joint statement: “This weekend, it became clear that the Trump Administration is finalizing plans to target and penalize people who are following federal law and contributing to our economy. “If taxpayers believe their private financial information could be used against them, they will be less likely to comply with tax laws.”The letter also referenced concerns about the recent abrupt removal of William Paul as Acting IRS Chief Counsel."

Under the new changes, which will be applicable from April 1, the power of scrutiny and issuing notices has been transferred to deputy excise and taxation commissioners (DETCs) from excise and taxation officers (ETOs).Withdrawal of certain powers from ETOs (inspector rank officers) and their transfer to a deputy commissioner rank officer is expected to bring accountability and reduce harassment of honest taxpayers. Setting up a panel of CAs for special audits, one-time settlement (OTS) scheme, installation of CCTV cameras in offices for transparency, changes in the system of (annual) audit, rebates up to 60% and waiver up to 100% (in certain cases) — these are among the key changes that may give relief to traders and businessmen. The state has introduced the OTS scheme, which will be implemented from next week. The scheme will be applicable to small taxpayers. Traders with pending dues of less than Rs 1 lakh will receive a 100% waiver. The state will waive off their tax, interest and penalty.For traders with pending tax dues of Rs 1 to Rs 10 lakh, the govt will give a rebate of 60% on the principal tax amount, interest and penalty. Around 1.5 lakh traders in this category will benefit.For traders with pending dues of Rs 10 lakh to Rs 10 crore, the state will give a rebate of 50% on the principal tax amount, interest, and penalty. In total, nearly 2 lakh small and medium traders and businessmen will benefit.GST expert and former chairman of NIRC of ICAI Naveen Garg said the transfer of power from lower-level officers to senior officers is expected to reduce the chances of harassment to traders and businessmen. ""The commissioner rank officers have more knowledge and experience and they have a better understanding. It will increase accountability,"" said Garg, adding that the changes will increase the ease of doing business in the state and will also attract investment and businesses from other states.Garg said Haryana is the first state to make such changes, and it will encourage other states to bring in similar changes in their respective regions. He said the provision for installing CCTV cameras in the offices of ETO and DETC will also help in bringing transparency to the system.The govt has also made changes in the system of audit. Until now, traders and businesses had to undergo annual audits. Now, they will have to undergo audits once every four-five years. The state has decided to form a panel of CAs for special audits to be conducted on behalf of the department. ""This will save time as it will reduce the number of trips to GST offices by traders and businesses,"" said Garg. He emphasised that the department is for collecting tax from tax evaders and checking irregularities, and it should not harass honest taxpayers.Under the GST law, taxes are calculated and collected based on self-declarations given by traders and businesses. However, the department has the power to scrutinise and issue notices to check for any tax evasion and irregularities. In cases where a notice is issued by the SGST, the business must pay upfront 10% of the tax amount for which the notice was issued before they can appeal against the notice. ""This blocks the capital of the business and puts the burden of litigation and paperwork, which obstructs the business,"" CA Nimesh Vashisht said, adding that even if businesses get relief in appeal, the entire process wastes several months and creates hurdles for the businesses.From April 1, in cases related to tax collection of more than Rs 2 crore, the deputy excise taxation commissioner (DETC) will have the power to issue notices, whereas previously, the excise taxation officer (ETO) had this power. Similarly, the power of suo moto investigation (scrutiny) in cases of tax evasion was taken from the ETO and given to the joint excise and taxation commissioner. ""The chief minister held a series of meetings with the CA association and other bodies to seek their suggestions in Jan. Changes have been made based on the suggestions and feedback given to the chief minister,"" a senior govt official said. He said that the objective is to make the state business-friendly.According to experts, these changes will increase the ease of doing business and attract new investments and businesses to the state. For the financial year 2024-25, the state has set a target of Rs 63,348 crore, and by March 12, 2025, the state has already collected Rs 58,693 crore.","Setting up a panel of CAs for special audits, one-time settlement (OTS) scheme, installation of CCTV cameras in offices for transparency, changes in the system of (annual) audit, rebates up to 60% and waiver up to 100% (in certain cases) — these are among the key changes that may give relief to traders and businessmen.

""The civic authorities did not approach us to get us in the tax net when our housing society received the completion certificate around two and a half years ago. We took voluntary measures so that proper property tax is charged. In such cases, it is unjust to levy late payment charges on us,"" he said.The CSMC imposes a 2% late payment charge per month if the property tax is not paid for the first half before June 30 and before Dec 31 for the second half of the financial year. The monthly late payment charges have a compounding effect on the original tax amount. Many people whose properties were newly recorded are reeling under the financial burden.Earlier, the municipal limits had a large number of unregistered properties, even if property holders were occupying them for a considerable period. The CSMC announced 65% more tax if a property was recorded after the end of the last fiscal year. The decision, which was dubbed controversial and arbitrary by citizens, resulted in many citizens ensuring their property gets recorded with the civic body.Shiv Sena (UBT) politician and former standing committee chairman of CSMC, Raju Vaidya, said the sole rule of the administrator has paved the way for anarchy. ""The date of the property coming on record should be considered while imposing late payment charges. The CSMC itself gives the completion certificate and henceforth should become proactive in charging the property tax instead of making citizens run from pillar to post to come under the tax net,"" he said.When contacted, CSMC authorities said late payment charges are applied as per established rules. ""In many cases, we bring new properties under the tax net immediately after citizens start residing in them. In some cases, alert citizens ensure the completion of property tax-related formalities. Citizens with tax-related complaints are requested to attend the fortnightly grievance redressal programme,"" a senior CSMC official said.Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Navratri Wishes, Eid Messages and quotes !","Many people whose properties were newly recorded are reeling under the financial burden.Earlier, the municipal limits had a large number of unregistered properties, even if property holders were occupying them for a considerable period.
